# Gravitational Force
---

fundamental nature force that attracts objects together
this is explained in **Newtons law of universal gravitation**

![Newtons formula for universal gravitation](./assets/gravity_formula.png)

- F is magnitude of gravitational force between the two objects
- G is the gravitational constant (9.8m/s^2)
- m1 & m2 are the masses of the 2 objects
- r is the distance between the centers of the two masses

## Influence on other forces
gravitational force has an obvious effect on [Normal Force](normal.md)
[Tension Force](tension.md) is a result of the response to gravitational force on the object the rope is holding, creating tension on the string.

Elastic ([Spring Force](spring.md)) is stretched by gravitational force when an object is suspended from a spring.
