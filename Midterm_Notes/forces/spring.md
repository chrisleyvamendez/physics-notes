# Springs
---

> the force exerted on a spring when it is **compressed** or **stretched from rest**

the force acts opposite to the displacement, trying to **reach back to its original form**

## Hooke's Law
---
> F = -kx
- **F** is the force exherted on the spring
- **k** is the **spring constant**
- **x** is the displacement

**This law states that force is directly proportional to displacement**
the negative values tells us that this is a restoring force, that is, it is trying to restore the force causing it to be displaced in the first place

If a spring is stretched, it is measured as the displacement x
The material the spring is made up of is what will determine the force constant

### Types of Springs
1. [Linear Springs](./spring_types/linear.md)
1. [Non-Linear Springs](./spring_types/non_linear.md)


### Ability to store energy
springs can store energy when you compress or stretch a spring you are inputting work into the spring. This energy can later be **released**
