# Frictional Force
---

Resistive Force that occurs **when two surfaces attempt to move across each other**

## the primary effect of friction is to resist motion
frictional forces are tangential to the surfaces in contact, and they act in opposite direction to the motion (attempted motion)

there are different types of friction
- [Static Friction](./friction_types/static.md)
- [Kinetic/Dynamic Friction](./friction_types/kinetic_dynamic.md)
- [Rolling Friction](./friction_types/rolling.md)
