# Static Frictional Force
---

> the force of friction on an object that is not moving

You can think of this as a force that keeps an object at rest.

Static Friction acts on objects **when they are not moving**
it **must be overcome by an external force** to start motion

## Static Friction is usually higher than other types of friction
This means that it usually takes *more* force to start moving an object, than to keep it moving.
